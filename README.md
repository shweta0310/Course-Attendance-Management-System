# Course-Attendance-Management-System
Database Management Course Project (CO303)
  
## Overview  
The system helps to ease the process of maintaining student attendance in paper.  
The following are the users of the system: Admin, Faculty and Student.   
The Admin-user is a super-user who monitors the whole system.  
If the user is a faculty, he can mark and monitor each student's attendance for his lectures. Also, teachers can add and delete courses for their students.  
If the user is a student, he must first register himself for the courses he is interested to attend. Then he will be able to check his attendance status for each of his registered course to ensure that he is regular to all his classes.
